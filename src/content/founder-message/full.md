Hey business owner,

Being a Tradie is hard enough,<br/>
Trust me I get it

I've header it all from family, friends and now even clients <br />
It's a war out there.

When you first signed up to be a tradie, did you ever comprehend all the day to day tasks you'd have to manage? Schedules, ordering, admin, marketing and the long list of chores that bring you nothing but headahches and do so little for the money needle.<br />
Probably not...

So for the past few years you've played the juggling act, just getting through the day by the grit of your teeth.<br /> Dont worry, aby sane person would feel the same, especially when you're limited to your own time and resources.

But it's 2021 now and things are a little different, smart phones, smart TV's and pretty soon we'll be driving smart cars.

So, it's about time you invest in a SMART-SYSTEM

I'm talking about automation (to get your time back)

Artificial Intelligence (becuase well... computers are smarter than we are) and a 24/7 marketplace that never fatigues (because for the first time ever, we have access to one... THE INTERNET)

I'm guessing you've been online for a while

Trying to find the latest trends and hacks to solve all your problems.

Or you've looked through 20 different agencies that are all offering the same damn thing.

'With over 10 years of experience'

'The most affordable prices'

Or the best of all

'We guarantee an increase in your web traffic' Well, guess what...

All that means nothing unless strangers end up knocking at your door, requesting to book your services.

People are not coming to your website, hoping the history of your business can solve their problems. They

WANT a SOLUTION and the WANT it NOW

That's what makes us different

We only care about the results and we wont stop until we achieve them

If you want to work with a team that actually priorities return on investment and treats your business like their own, then book a complimentary strategy session.

It'll be the best opportunity for us to meet each other and undergo a thorough insepection of the follow:

-   Current website
-   Social media channels
-   Email lists
-   Long term goals
-   Current business position

From this I will be able to offer the most practical suggestions moving forward and... only if you are READY.

We'll get to work<br />(remember this, as we'll advise you ourselves if we think the business is ready for growth.) It's nothing personal. it's just we dont business pissing money up the wall, when they don't have their ducks in order.

I forgot to mention,<br />
There's no lock in contracts... because who the hell wants to be held hostage. NOT ME...
